# Contributing to react-loading-skeleton

Contributions are welcome.

## Development

3. Check for type errors: `yarn tsc`
4. Run Rollup: `yarn build`
5. Run tests: `yarn test`

## Publishing

1. Make sure that the CI workflow succeeded.
2. Increment version in `package.json`.
3. (If production release) Add a git tag in the format `v1.0.0`.
4. Commit and push. Remember to push tags as well with `git push --tags`.
5. `yarn npm publish` or `yarn npm publish --tag next`. The `prepack` script will automatically do a clean and build.
